# PyThello
My capstone project put together to polish off my degree.  A fun little Othello engine put together by me.  The main attraction to this little guy would be the ease of which one can plug their own AI into the engine with little effort!


You will need to make sure that pygame is installed before this can be ran, otherwise it should be as simple as running the game!
There is still a bug in the "Batman" AI that does cause the game to crash, I can look into this in the future.
